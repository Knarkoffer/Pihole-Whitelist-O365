# PiholeWhitelistO365
Script to grab the DNS names associated with Office 365, and add them to the Pi-Hole whitelist

### Completed:
- [x] Remove old entries added by this script before any new whitelisting

### Left to do:

- [ ] Flags/switches with argparse (i.e. to allow non-required domains)
- [ ] Debug_print functions (with --verbose mode)
- [ ] Handle wildcard-domains (like *-files.sharepoint.com)
